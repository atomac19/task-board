# Project: CSS Grid Task Board

## Description
In this project, I create a board of to-do items organized into columns. All of the HTML and most of the CSS have been written for me, but I add the grid property declarations.
In order to complete this project, I lay out the structure of a gridâ€™s rows and columns and place items within that grid using CSS.
